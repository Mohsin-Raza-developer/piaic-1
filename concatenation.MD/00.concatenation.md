Sure! Based on your original example, here's how the output would look using each formatting method:

### Variables
```python
name = "Mohsin_raza"
father_name = "sohail"
age = 20
roll_no = 123
house_no = "13/11"
```

### 1. **String Concatenation**
```python
txt = "Hello! My name is " + name + ", my father's name is " + father_name + ", I am " + str(age) + " years old, my roll number is " + str(roll_no) + ", and my house number is " + house_no + "."
print(txt)
```
**Output:**
```
Hello! My name is Mohsin_raza, my father's name is sohail, I am 20 years old, my roll number is 123, and my house number is 13/11.
```

### 2. **f-Strings (Formatted String Literals)**
```python
txt = f"Hello! My name is {name}, my father's name is {father_name}, I am {age} years old, my roll number is {roll_no}, and my house number is {house_no}."
print(txt)
```
**Output:**
```
Hello! My name is Mohsin_raza, my father's name is sohail, I am 20 years old, my roll number is 123, and my house number is 13/11.
```

### 3. **`format()` Method**
```python
txt = "Hello! My name is {}, my father's name is {}, I am {} years old, my roll number is {}, and my house number is {}.".format(name, father_name, age, roll_no, house_no)
print(txt)
```
**Output:**
```
Hello! My name is Mohsin_raza, my father's name is sohail, I am 20 years old, my roll number is 123, and my house number is 13/11.
```

### 4. **Percent (`%`) Formatting (Old Style)**
```python
txt = "Hello! My name is %s, my father's name is %s, I am %d years old, my roll number is %d, and my house number is %s." % (name, father_name, age, roll_no, house_no)
print(txt)
```
**Output:**
```
Hello! My name is Mohsin_raza, my father's name is sohail, I am 20 years old, my roll number is 123, and my house number is 13/11.
```

All methods produce the same final output; they just use different syntax and techniques for string formatting.
